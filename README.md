# Bulletin Board App

Welcome to the Bulletin Board App! This application is designed to serve as a digital representation of a bulletin board, where users can post public messages and advertisements.

I have implemented all the points mentioned in the acceptance criteria as well as the bonus points. However, I did not implement authentication and authorization due to time constraints and other reasons, but the rest of the functionality is fully implemented.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 18+)
- npm (Node Package Manager)


### Technologies used

Following technologies are used in this assignment

- Sqlite3
- Nextjs
- Reactjs
- Prisma ORM

### Installation

1. **Unzip Solution:** Extract/unzip the solution file.

2. **Install Dependencies and Run Application:** Run the following command to install the required dependencies and run the application (Note: I created a bulletin.sh file for running all scripts in a single go):

    ```bash
    npm run bulletin:dev
    ```

### Running the App

If you want to run only the app, then run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev 
```

### Running Tests

If you want to run test, then run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Important Points

- I used cloudinary for image upload and I store its url in sqlite database
- I added creds of my cloud (As I need to submit it as zip so I added in it)
